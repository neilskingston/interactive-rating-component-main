### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

I started by making the two elements, the ratings card and the thankyou card, trying to use multi classing as much as possible to reduce repeating code. I then added the submit function, the rating selection and rating on the thankyou card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I expanded my knowledge of CSS grid which I'd like to use more in a future project. This was the first time I've used the DOM outside of a learning environment.

### Continued development

I'm going to tackle project on the next level on Frontend Mentor and optimizing my JS.
